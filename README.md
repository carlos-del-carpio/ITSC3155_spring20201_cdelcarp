# ITSC 3155 - Software Engineering

This project gave me the opportunity to experience a real life situation where a team of people are working on one code base making commits and changes.
The project spanned about half of the semester and it helped structure the team into different roles and every week the roles changed.
This was a real way to work through Git commits and changes to the project as weeks passed.
